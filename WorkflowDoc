This file contains the general workflow from initial LES simulation to plotting

1. Begin with large domain LES simulations with prognostic aerosol scheme (UWSAM.tar.gz), with additional capabilities for calculating momentum hyperdiffusion when using 100 m grid spacing to align better with 50 m simulations and the ability to conditionally sample the ship track region for 'in-plume' input parameters (all necessary subroutines included in this directory and they are compatible with the compressed version of UW-SAM).

2. Calculate the boundary-layer averaged aerosol concentration with Aerosol_3D.pro. The 2-D outputs from this routine will be fed into
