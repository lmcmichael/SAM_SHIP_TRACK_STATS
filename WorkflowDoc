This file contains the general workflow from initial LES simulation to plotting

1. Begin with large domain LES simulations with prognostic aerosol scheme (UWSAM.tar.gz), with additional capabilities for calculating momentum hyperdiffusion when using 100 m grid spacing to align better with 50 m simulations and the ability to conditionally sample the ship track region for 'in-plume' input parameters (all necessary subroutines included in this directory and they are compatible with the compressed version of UW-SAM).

2. Calculate the boundary-layer averaged aerosol concentration with Aerosol_3D.pro in ParticleModel directory. The 2-D outputs from this routine will be fed into LES_Width.m to fit Guassian curves to the LES data and estimate plume width. Ship_shear.pro is used to create the LES input parameter forcing files from conditionally-sampled LES statistics. Plot_crossections.pro is used to plot x-y figures of 3-D LES output.

3. Once LES input parameter forcing files and LES-estimated ship track widths are available, C_0 parameter fitting is done using particlemodel_LSE.m. Once C_0 has been determined, these constants for the different conditional average categories are applied to the different cases in particlemodel_(case).m. Plot_widths.m plots various particle model plume widths and errors with LES-estimated widths.
